# Titanic-Data-
Titanic Data Analysis and Predictive Machine Learning Pipeline

Project is an in-depth analysis of the Titanic dataset, combined with the creation of a robust data pipeline and the use of machine learning algorithms to predict the survival of passengers. This project explores various techniques for data analysis, preprocessing, and model training to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features such as age, sex, class, and other variables.
